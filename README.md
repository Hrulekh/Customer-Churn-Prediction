# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This repository contains the implementation of a Customer Churn Prediction project aimed at predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The project demonstrates various aspects of data science including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model development.

# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the development and evaluation of predictive models. The objective is to analyze customer behavior and identify those at risk of churning, allowing for proactive customer retention strategies.

## Dataset
The project uses the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset from Kaggle.
